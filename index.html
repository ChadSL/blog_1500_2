            <p>Billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency has been spent
                buying virtual land in Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse.
                $1.93 billion has been spent on land in this past year alone.
                Land is being purchased in these online worlds mainlyfor self promotion,
                stores, galleries, and more. Leaked memos show people do not stay for long
                although the company is convinced more people will stay as the 
                virtual world develops. </p>
