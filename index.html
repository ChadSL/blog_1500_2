            <p>Billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency has been spent
                buying virtual land in Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse.<br>
                $1.93 billion has been spent on land in this past year alone.
                Land is being purchased in these online worlds mainly for self promotion,
                stores, galleries, and more.<br> Leaked memos show people do not stay for long
                although the company is convinced more people will stay as the 
                virtual world develops. </p>
