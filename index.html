            <p>Billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency has been spent
                buying virtual land in Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse.
                $1.93 billion has been spent on land in this past year alone.
                Land is being purchased in these online worlds mainly for self promotion,
                stores, galleries, and more. Leaked memos show people do not stay for long
                although the company is convinced more people will stay as the 
                virtual world develops. </p>

            <p>According to the China Game Industry Group Committe, young people in China have
                gotten over their addictions to video games. Since August in 2021 China has banned
                all children from gaming for more than three hours a week. This was done as part of China's
                crackdown on their technology sector. Affected by this was one of the world's biggest
                gaming companies, Tencent. According to reports 75% of children in China now play for less
                than 3 hours a week which they consider to be "remarkable results".

            <h2>San Francisco to allow police 'killer robots'</h2>

            allowed police to use robots that have the capability to kill.">

            <p>San Franciso's police force have recently been approved to use
                lethal robots. The new measure also allows police to deploy robots equipped with
                explosives in "extreme circumstances". SFPD have said that they 
                currently do not operate robots at lethal force, but they already have
                approval to do so. Some think this is good as this will allow police to engage
                dangerous situations without risk to their own lives. Those opposed to the new
                measure fear this is a slippery slope to further militarisation of the police force.
                The measure does however limit the robots to high-ranking officers and are only allowed
                to be used after empolying alternative de-escalation tactics.

            <p>Artifical Intelligence is advancing extremelly fast with AI programs
                capable of creating art, videos, and lots of controversy. These technologies
                have been in the works for years but we are starting to see public releases
                of these programs. A new chatbot enabled by OpenAI's GPT system marks a huge step
                forward for machine intelligence. Engineers are asking chat programs for coding help,
                and it is also being used by researchers to test the ethical boundaries. This is only
                the beginning- AI is going to continue to advance incredibly fast in the near future.
